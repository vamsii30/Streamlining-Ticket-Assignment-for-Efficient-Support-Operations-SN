Day 2 – Creation of Custom Table and Security Controls

Objective:
To design a dedicated table for recording operational issues, structure it with appropriate fields, and secure it using role-based access and ACL policies.

Tasks Executed:

Table Setup: Developed a new table (Operations Related) under System Definition → Tables. Enabled both the Create and Mobile Create modules. Added required fields for capturing issue information.

Choice Field Configuration: Customized the Issue field using Form Design with predefined options:

Login failure

404 page error

Certification-related concerns

Account expiration

User–Group Mapping:

Assigned Katherine Pierce to the Certificates Group with the Certification_role.

Assigned Manne Niranjan to the Platform Group with the Platform_role.

Access Restrictions: Applied permissions so only members with Platform_role or Certification_role have read/write access. Used the security_admin role to authorize secured updates.

ACL Implementation: Created field-level ACLs under System Security → Access Control. Linked the admin role where necessary for additional privileges.

Evidence: Screenshots taken for table creation, form configuration, user–group assignments, and ACL rules.
