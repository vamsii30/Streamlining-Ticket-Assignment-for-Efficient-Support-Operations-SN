Optimizing Ticket Assignment for Effective Support in ServiceNow

This project focuses on building a structured and automated ticket assignment process in ServiceNow.
The solution reduces manual intervention by ensuring that each issue is routed to the correct team, improving speed and accuracy in resolving requests.

ðŸ“‹ Overview

Manual ticket assignment often leads to delays and errors in service operations.
To overcome this, the project introduces a systematic framework that:

Establishes clear structures for users, groups, and roles

Creates a custom table to capture and track operational issues

Applies role-based ACLs to protect sensitive data

Uses Flow Designer to automatically direct tickets to the right group

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Define a structured user, group, and role hierarchy

Secure data with access controls and ACLs

Automate ticket routing to appropriate groups

Reduce repetitive manual tasks and enhance efficiency

âœ¨ Major Components
ðŸ”¹ Users, Groups, and Roles

Created distinct test users with unique attributes

Organized users into groups (Platform, Certification)

Assigned roles matching responsibilities

Established proper mapping between Users â†’ Groups â†’ Roles

ðŸ”¹ Custom Table for Operational Issues

Built a new table Operations Related under System Definition â†’ Tables

Enabled Create and Mobile Create modules for flexibility

Structured fields with predefined issue types such as:

Platform login failures

404 errors

Certification issues

Expired user accounts

Restricted permissions so only Platform and Certification roles could access the table

ðŸ”¹ Access Control (ACLs)

Applied ACLs for role-based security

Restricted read/write operations to authorized groups

Used security_admin role for privileged updates

Configured field-level ACLs for granular access management

ðŸ”¹ Flow Designer Automation

Implemented automated flows for ticket routing:

Flow 1 â€“ Certificate Requests

Trigger: Record created/updated in Operations Related

Condition: Issue = Certificate-related

Action: Assign ticket to Certificates Group

Flow 2 â€“ Platform Issues

Trigger: Record created/updated in Operations Related

Conditions: Login problem, 404 error, or expired user

Action: Assign ticket to Platform Group

Both flows were configured, tested, saved, and activated successfully.

âœ… Conclusion

The project successfully automated ticket handling in ServiceNow by combining user/group management, ACL security, and Flow Designer automation.

With this solution:

Tickets are routed directly to the correct team

Resolution and response times are improved

Access remains secure with role-based controls

The framework is scalable to support additional issue categories in the future

This setup enhances service operations, boosts team productivity, and ensures a smoother experience for end-users.
